      <description>Who am I? Name: Christopher Vest
Profession: DevOps Engineer
Location: London, UK
What is this? This is my personal website.
Why? In December 2018, I read an article discussing how a personal website could replace Facebook. Over the last few years I have become increasingly frustrated with social media - as such I was intrigued with this idea. I decided to give it a go, with the intention of perhaps phasing out other forms of social media entirely.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Below you will find a guide on how to use the Vault PKI secrets engine to generate an intermediate CA to use with the Strimzi Kafka Operator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

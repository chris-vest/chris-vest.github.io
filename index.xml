      <description>Who am I? My name is Chris Vest and I work as a DevOps Engineer in London, United Kingdom.

Over the last few years I have become increasingly frustrated with social media - as such I was intrigued with this idea. I decided to give it a go, with the intention of perhaps phasing out other forms of social media entirely.</description>

Since I had received so much help in general regarding running Kafka on Kubernetes from the Strimzi guys, this seemed like an appropriate way to give back!
Here is the post in full&amp;hellip;

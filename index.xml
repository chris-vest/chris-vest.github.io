      <description>Migrating to ArgoCD from Weaveworks Flux &amp;amp; Flux Helm Operator   Add all raw manifests (i.e. not HelmReleases) to your repo(s) which ArgoCD is watching
  Add references to these manifests as Applications in ArgoCD - do not enable pruning unless you want to play with fire; you can also disable autosync if you want in order to avoid never-ending deployment cycles if differences are found between what Flux and ArgoCD see as the state.</description>

      <description>Terraform Cycle error Using Seth Vargo&#39;s project for running vault-on-gke, I ran into the Terraform Cycle error when pulling in the latest changes from his repo (which we had forked). Both Terraform and I were happy with the plan, so I decided to go ahead with the apply. That&#39;s when I saw this:
That&#39;s not particularly clear, so I decided to run terraform graph -draw-cycles -type=apply. This proved to be useless, because it didn&#39;t highlight any cycles at all.</description>

      <description>Who am I? My name is Chris Vest and I work as a DevOps Engineer in London, United Kingdom.
What is this? This is my personal website.
Why? In December 2018, I read an article discussing how a personal website could replace Facebook. Over the last few years I have become increasingly frustrated with social media - as such I was intrigued with this idea. So I decided to give it a go!</description>

      <title>Using Vault PKI with the Strimzi Kafka Operator on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>I originally wrote this post for the Strimzi blog after having worked on it for a project at my work. I figured it would benefit the community to know how I had done this. Since I had received so much help in general regarding running Kafka on Kubernetes from the Strimzi guys, this seemed like an appropriate way to give back!
Here is the post in full&amp;hellip;
